abstract = {World knowledge enters into pragmatic utterance interpreta- tion in complex ways, and may be defeasible in light of speak- ers' utterances. Yet there is to date a surprising lack of sys- tematic investigation into the role of world knowledge in prag- matic inference. In this paper, we show that a state-of-the-art model of pragmatic interpretation greatly overestimates the in- fluence of world knowledge on the interpretation of utterances like Some of the marbles sank. We extend the model to cap- ture the idea that the listener is uncertain about the background knowledge the speaker is bringing to the conversation. This extension greatly improves model predictions of listeners' in- terpretation and also makes good qualitative predictions about listeners' judgments of how ‘normal' the world is in light of a speaker's statement. Theoretical and methodological implica- tions are discussed. Keywords:},

abstract = {In the face of underspecified utterances, listeners routinely and without much apparent effort make the right kinds of pragmatic inferences about a speaker's intended meaning. This dissertation investigates the processing of scalar impli- catures as a way of addressing how listeners perform this remarkable feat. In particular, the role of context in the processing of scalar implicatures from some to not all is explored. Contrary to the widely held assumption that scalar impli- catures are highly regularized, frequent, and relatively context-independent, this dissertation suggests that they are in fact relatively infrequent and highly context- dependent; both the robustness and the speed with which scalar implicatures from some to not all are computed are modulated by the probabilistic support that the implicature receives from multiple contextual cues. Scalar implicatures are found to be especially sensitive to the naturalness or expectedness of both scalar and non-scalar alternative utterances the speaker could have produced, but didn't. A novel contextualist account of scalar implicature processing that has roots in both constraint-based and information-theoretic accounts of language processing is proposed that provides a unifying explanation for a) the varying robustness of scalar implicatures across different contexts, b) the varying speed of scalar implica- tures across different contexts, and c) the speed and efficiency of communication.},

In this paper, we formulate a family of increasingly sophisticated models of question-answer behavior within the Rational Speech Act framework. We compare these models based on three different pieces of evidence: first, we demonstrate how our answerer models capture a classic effect in psycholinguistics showing that an answerer’s level of informativeness varies with the inferred questioner goal, while keeping the question constant. Second, we jointly test the questioner and answerer components of our model based on empirical evidence from a question-answer reasoning game. Third, we examine a special case of this game to further distinguish among the questioner models. We find that sophisticated pragmatic reasoning is needed to account for some of the data. People can use questions to provide cues to the answerer about their interest, and can select answers that are informative about inferred interests.},

abstract = {Referring is one of the most basic and prevalent uses of language. How do speakers choose from the wealth of referring expressions at their disposal? Rational theories of language use have come under attack for decades for not being able to account for the seemingly irrational overinformativeness ubiquitous in referring expressions. Here we present a novel production model of referring expressions within the Rational Speech Act framework that treats speakers as agents that rationally trade off cost and informativeness of utterances. Crucially, we relax the assumption that informativeness is computed with respect to a deterministic Boolean semantics, in favor of a non-deterministic continuous semantics. This innovation allows us to capture a large number of seemingly disparate phenomena within one unified framework: the basic asymmetry in speakers' propensity to overmodify with color rather than size; the increase in overmodification in complex scenes; the increase in overmodification with atypical features; and the increase in specificity in nominal reference as a function of typicality. These findings cast a new light on the production of referring expressions: rather than being wastefully overinformative, reference is usefully redundant.},

We focus on another type of context-dependence that quantifiers share with other lexical items: talker variability. Different talkers might use quantifiers with different interpretations in mind. We used a web-based crowdsourcing paradigm to study participants' expectations about the use of many and some based on recent exposure. We first established that the mapping of some and many onto quantities (candies in a bowl) is variable both within and between participants. We then examined whether and how listeners' expectations about quantifier use adapts with exposure to talkers who use quantifiers in different ways. The results demonstrate that listeners can adapt to talker-specific biases in both how often and with what intended meaning many and some are used.},

We collected freely produced referring expressions in a multi-player reference game experiment, where we manipulated the object’s context. We find that utterance choice is affected by the contextual informativeness of a description, its length and frequency, and the typicality of the object for that description.

The studies differ only in the dependent measure used: Exp. 1 uses truth judgements, Exp. 2 uses word probability ratings, and Exp. 3 uses a direct measure of sentence interpretation. We argue that the first two are effectively measures of production, and find they are sensitive to our contextual manipulations. In contrast the interpretation measure shows no effect of context.

It has long been observed that projective content varies in how projective it is (e.g., Karttunen, 1971; Simons, 2001; Abusch, 2010), though preliminary experimental research has been able to confirm only some of the intuitions about projection variability (e.g., Smith & Hall, 2011; Xue & Onea, 2011). Given the sparse empirical evidence for projection variability, the first goal of this paper was to investigate projection variability for projective content associated with 19 expressions of American English. The second goal was to explore the hypothesis, called the Gradient Projection Principle, that content projects to the extent that it is not at-issue. The findings of two pairs of experiments provide robust empirical evidence for projection variability and for the Gradient Projection Principle. We show that many analyses of projection cannot account for the observed projection variability and discuss the implications of our finding that projective content varies in its at-issueness for an empirically adequate analysis of projection.},

abstract = {A common dependent measure used in visual-world eye-tracking experiments is the proportion of looks to a visually depicted object in a certain time window after the onset of the critical stimulus. When interpreting such data, a common assumption is that looks to the object reflect the listener’s belief that the object is the intended target referent. While this is intuitively plausible (at least for paradigms in which the task requires selecting a referent), relatively little is known about how exactly the proportion of looks to an object is related to a listener’s current belief about that object. Here, we test a simple, explicit linking hypothesis: the proportion of looks to an object reflects the probability that the listener assigns to the object being the target. To test this hypothesis, we supplement the eye-tracking data from Leffel, Xiang, and Kennedy (2016) with an offline incremental decision task to measure participants’ beliefs about the intended referent at various points in the unfolding sentence, and assess the extent to which these beliefs predict the eye-tracking data. The results suggest that the degree to which an object is believed to be the referent is only one factor that affects eye movements in referential tasks. Preliminary free production data we have collected for the scenes suggests that utterance expectations also play a role. We discuss methodological implications of these results for experimental linguistics.},

We then describe a rational model of adjective use in which listeners explicitly reason about judgments made by different speakers, formalizing the notion of subjectivity as agreement between speakers. We show that, once incremental processing is combined with memory limitations, our model predicts effects both of subjectivity and mutual information. We confirm the adequacy of our model by evaluating it on corpus data, finding that it correctly predicts ordering in unseen data with an accuracy of 96.2 %.

Within experimental pragmatics, many of the core questions have relied on the operationalization of the theoretical notion of `implicature rate'. Implicature rate based results have informed the work on acquisition, online processing, and scalar diversity, inter alia. Implicature rate has typically been quantified as the proportion of `pragmatic' judgments in two-alternative forced choice truth value judgment tasks. Despite its theoretical importance, this linking hypothesis from implicature rate to behavioral responses has never been extensively tested. Here we show that two factors dramatically affect the `implicature rate' inferred from truth value judgment tasks: a) the number of responses provided to participants; and b) the linking hypothesis about what constitutes a `pragmatic' judgment. We argue that it is time for the field of experimental pragmatics to engage more seriously with its foundational assumptions about how theoretical notions map onto behaviorally measurable quantities, and present a sketch of an alternative linking hypothesis that derives behavior in truth value judgment tasks from probabilistic utterance expectations.},

Our paradigm thus contributes to a domain of experimental research on evidential expressions that is only just takingshape at the crossroads of theoretical semantics/pragmatics and psycholinguistics; weprovide a potential starting point for approaching theoretical debates on the nature ofmodal evidential expressions from an experimental and context-oriented perspective.},

abstract = {The current DMUC reports on the organization of an experimental semantics/pragmatics project that investigated the extent to which variability in projective content’s projectivity is predicted by that content’s at-issueness (Tonhauser, Beaver, & Degen, 2018). The project included four web-based experiments in which participants adjusted sliding scales to provide projectivity and at-issueness ratings for close to 300 items. The workflow and best practices we report here are generalizable to any sufficiently similar web-based study, as well as to in-lab studies and dependent measures that differ substantially from the reported ones, e.g., online measures like eye movements. We also acknowledge that experimental semantics/pragmatics projects increasingly include a computational cognitive modeling component in addition to standard experimental data analysis. While the current DMUC does not include a cognitive model, we add some remarks on how to maintain development and documentation of cognitive models towards the end of this chapter. The following also describes best practices within the first author’s interActive Language Processing Lab at Stanford (ALPS) as of the time of publication. We close with some reflections on what we would change, were we to start again from scratch.}

abstract = {Transmission of information by means of language is a potentially lossy process. Especially adjunct information, such as the graded degree of evidence, is a piece of information that seems prima facie likely to be distorted by reproduction noise. To investigate this issue, we present the results of a two- step iterated narration study: first, we collected a corpus of 250 crime story reproductions that were produced in parallel reproduction chains of 5 generations in depth, for 5 different seed stories; a second separate large-scale experiment then targeted readers’ interpretation of these reproductions. Crucially, strength of evidence for the guilt of each story’s suspect(s) was manipulated in the initial seed stories. Across generations, readers’ guilt perceptions decreased when the evidence was originally strong, but remained stable when evidence was originally weak. Analysis of linguistic measures revealed that dissimilarity between a seed story and its reproduction, story length, and amount of hedging language affected the readers’ own guilt perception and the readers’ attribution of guilt perception to the author differently. The results provide evidence that evidential information indeed influences guilt perception in complex ways.},

abstract = {Speakers exhibit variability in their choice between uncertainty expressions such as might and probably. Recent work has found that listeners cope with such variability by updating their expectations about how a specific speaker uses uncertainty expressions when interacting with a single speaker. However, it is still unclear to what extent listeners form speaker-specific expectations for multiple speakers and to what extent listeners are adapting to a situation independent of the speakers. Here, we take a first step towards answering these questions. In Experiment 1, listeners formed speaker-specific expectations after being exposed to two speakers whose use of uncertainty expressions differed. In Experiment 2, listeners who were exposed to two speakers with identical use of uncertainty expressions formed considerably stronger expectations than in Experiment 1. This suggests that listeners form both speaker-specific and situation-specific expectations. We discuss the implications of these results for theories of adaptation.},

title = {{I know what you’re probably going to say: Listener adaptation to variable use of uncertainty expressions}},
abstract = {Pragmatic theories of utterance interpretation share the assumption that listeners reason about alternative utterances that a speaker could have produced, but didn't. For such reasoning to be successful, listeners must have precise expectations about a speaker's production choices. This is at odds with the considerable variability across speakers that exists at all levels of linguistic representation. This tension can be reconciled by listeners adapting to the statistics of individual speakers. While linguistic adaptation is increasingly widely attested, semantic/pragmatic adaptation is underexplored. Moreover, what kind of representations listeners update during semantic/pragmatic adaptation – estimates of the speaker's lexicon, or estimates of the speaker's utterance preferences – remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate semantic/pragmatic adaptation in the domain of uncertainty expressions like might and probably. In a series of web-based experiments, we find 1) that listeners vary in their expectations about a generic speaker's use of uncertainty expressions; 2) that listeners rapidly update their expectations about the use of uncertainty expressions after brief exposure to a speaker with a specific usage of uncertainty expressions; and 3) that listeners' interpretations of uncertainty expressions change after being exposed to a specific speaker. We present a novel computational model of semantic/pragmatic adaptation based on Bayesian belief updating and show, through a series of model comparisons, that semantic/pragmatic adaptation is best captured by listeners updating their beliefs both about the speaker's lexicon and their utterance preferences. This work has implications for both semantic theories of uncertainty expressions and psycholinguistic theories of adaptation: it highlights the need for dynamic semantic representations and provides evidence against accounts that cast adaptation as simple low-level priming.},

In this work, we explore to what extent neural network sentence encoders can learn to predict the strength of scalar inferences. We first show that an LSTM-based sentence encoder trained on an English dataset of human inference strength ratings is able to predict ratings with high accuracy (r = 0.78). We then probe the model’s behavior using manually constructed minimal sentence pairs and corpus data. We find that the model inferred previously established associations between linguistic features and inference strength, suggesting that the model learns to use linguistic features to predict pragmatic inferences.},

We also investigate the effect of raising participants’ awareness of communicatively stronger alternatives that explicitly encode an exhaustive meaning (e.g. some but not all with respect to some). Our results suggest that exhaustive alternatives (which are ‘symmetric’ to canonical alternatives) can modulate the availability and strength of scalar inferences, and that semantic uncertainty is an independent channel through which scalar inferences are modulated.

Constraint-based accounts, which seek to unify these conflicting results, make a prediction which we test here: the probability of an interpretation and the speed with which it is processed depends on the contextual support it receives. We manipulated contextual support for the scalar inference in two truth-value judgment experiments by manipulating a lexical feature (presence of partitive “of the”) and a pragmatic feature (the implicit Question Under Discussion). Participants’ responder type – whether their majority response was pragmatic (reflecting the inference) or literal (reflecting its absence) – was the main predictor of response times: pragmatic responses were faster than literal responses when generated by pragmatic responders; the reverse was true for literal responders. We interpret this as further evidence against costly inference accounts and in support of constraint-based accounts of pragmatic processing.},

We use the average surprisal of words for the model, which encodes sequential predictability, as a predictor for the age of acquisition of words in early child language. We compare this predictor to word frequency and others and find that average surprisal is a good predictor for the age of acquisition of function words and predicates beyond frequency, but not for nouns. Our approach provides insight into what makes a good model of early word learning, especially for words whose meanings rely heavily on linguistic context.},

Adjective production probabilities a listener expects for objects in a context drive the size of contrastive inferences: the greater the asymmetry in expectation for a speaker to use a pre-nominal adjective for the target rather than for competitors, the greater the listener’s resulting target preference. Modifier production probabilities were collected (Exp. 1) and used to make predictions about comprehension in an incremental decision task (Exp. 2). The model’s interpretation predictions are supported by the data. This account has the potential to explain the fluctuating appearance of contrastive inferences and shifts the explanatory focus away from contrastive inference towards online interpretation of referring expressions more broadly.},

	 title={{Modeling word and morpheme order in natural language as an efficient tradeoff of memory and surprisal}},
	 abstract = {Memory limitations are known to constrain language comprehension and production, and have beenargued to account for crosslinguistic word order regularities. However, a systematic assessment of therole of memory limitations in language structure has proven elusive, in part because it is hard to ex-tract precise large-scale quantitative generalizations about language from existing mechanistic modelsof memory use in sentence processing. We provide an architecture-independent information-theoreticformalization of memory limitations which enables a simple calculation of the memory efficiency oflanguages.  Our notion of memory efficiency is based  on the idea of amemory–surprisal tradeoff:  acertain level of average surprisal per word can only be achieved at the cost of storing some amount ofinformation about past context. Based on this notion of memory usage, we advance theEfficient TradeoffHypothesis: the order of elements in natural language is under pressure to enable favorable memory-surprisal tradeoffs. We derive that languages enable more efficient tradeoffs when they exhibitinforma-tion locality: when predictive information about an element is concentrated in its recent past. We provideempirical evidence from three test domains in support of the Efficient Tradeoff Hypothesis: a reanalysisof a miniature artificial language learning experiment, a large-scale study of word order in corpora of54 languages, and an analysis of morpheme order in two agglutinative languages. These results suggestthat principles of order in natural language can be explained via highly generic cognitively motivatedprinciples and lend support to efficiency-based models of the structure of human language.},

A computational model of referring expression production that accounts for many of the key patterns in redundant adjectival modification assumes that adjectives differ in how noisy (reliable), and consequently, how useful they are for reference. Here we investigate one hypothesis about the source of the assumed adjectival noise: that it reflects the perceptual difficulty of establishing whether the property denoted by the adjective holds of the contextually relevant objects. In Exp.1, we collect perceptual difficulty norms for items that vary in color and material. In Exp. 2, we test the highest (material) and lowest (color) perceptual dif- ficulty items in a reference game and find that material is indeed less likely to be mentioned redundantly, replicating previous work. In Exp. 3, we obtain norms for the tested items in a second perceptual difficulty measure with the aim of testing the effect of perceptual difficulty within property type. The overall results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that the propensity to redundantly use color over material adjectives may be driven by the relative ease of assessing an object’s color, compared to the relative difficulty of assessing its material.}

abstract = {Properties of the content of the clausal complement have long been assumed to distinguish factive predicates like 'know' from non-factive ones like 'think' (Kiparsky and Kiparsky 1970, i.a.). There is, however, disagreement about which properties define factive predicates as well as uncertainty about whether the content of the complement of particular predicates exhibit the properties attributed to the content of the complement of factive predicates. This has led to a lack of consensus about which predicates are factive, a troublesome situation given the central role that factivity plays in linguistic theorizing. This paper reports six experiments designed to investigate two critical properties of the content of the complement of clause-embedding predicates, namely projection and entailment, with the goal of establishing whether these properties identify a class of factive predicates. We find that factive predicates are more heterogeneous than previously assumed and that there is little empirical support from these experiments for the assumed categorical distinction between factive and non-factive predicates. We discuss implications of our results for formal analyses of presuppositions, one area where factivity has played a central role. We propose that projection is sensitive to more fine-grained meaning distinctions between clause-embedding predicates than factivity.},
