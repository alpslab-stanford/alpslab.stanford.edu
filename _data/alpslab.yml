          Judith did her undergrad and MSc work in Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabrück and her PhD work in Brain & Cognitive Sciences and Linguistics at the University of Rochester. She is interested in how people construct meaning in communication. She spends her time thinking about how to characterize the interaction of linguistic information, context, and world knowledge in language production and comprehension.

          Jiayi did his undergraduate study in Linguistics, Neuroscience, and Integrated Sciences at Northwestern University before coming to Stanford. Jiayi is primarily interested in psycholinguistics and syntax. Specifically, he is interested in exploring the various factors that affect sentence acceptability judgments, and how experimental methods can inform syntactic theories.

          Bran is a second-year PhD student of Linguistics. Their interests include language and gender, language and music, and socio- and psycholinguistics more broadly. They also occasionally enjoy straying into morphology, and their current QP deals with English gender morphology and social ideologies. They also enjoy the language-learning side of linguistics, and have studied Spanish, Faroese, Russian, Mandarin, and Greek.

          Tony is a second-year PhD student in Linguistics. He is interested in sociolinguistics, especially third-wave variationist work, and the intersection between social and semantic/pragmatic meaning, as well as exploring how an understanding of language as socially and cognitively embedded can provide paths forward in modelling language behavior. His current work focuses on Bayesian modelling of the impacts of social information on semantic interpretation.
